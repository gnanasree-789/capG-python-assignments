#Your task is to design an Employee Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as 
# abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism in Python.

# Instructions:
# Create an Interface Employee (Abstract Base Class)

# Define an abstract class Employee using the ABC module.
# Include two abstract methods:
# work(self) -> str: Defines the work responsibilities of the employee.
# get_salary(self) -> float: Returns the salary of the employee.
# Implement Concrete Employee Classes

# Create two classes, Manager and Developer, that inherit from Employee.
# Each class should implement the work method to describe the employeeâ€™s role.
# Implement the get_salary method to return the salary of the employee.
# Create a Department Class to Manage Employees

# The Department class should store a list of employees.
# Implement methods:
# hire(self, employee: Employee): Adds an employee to the department.
# fire(self, employee: Employee): Removes an employee from the department.
# get_total_salary(self) -> float: Returns the total salary of all employees.
# show_employee_details(self): Displays all employees, their salary, and work description.
# Test the Implementation

# Create instances of Manager and Developer with names and salaries.
# Add them to a Department and display their details.
# Calculate and print the total salary expense.
